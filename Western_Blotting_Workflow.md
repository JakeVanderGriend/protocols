## Western Blotting Workflow:

# Day 1:

Grow overnights of strains, 3mL per strain is sufficient.

# Day 2:

Prepping Samples:

Chemical Prep: 
1.	Add ß-mercaptoethanol to an aliquot of 2X Laemmli loading buffer at a ratio of 50uL to 950uL 2X Laemmli. (In fume hood)
   
Sample prep:
1.	Take OD of culture:
* Dilute 100uL of O/N into 900uL 70% IO in an eppi tube, vortex, and transfer to a cuvette.
* Divide produced OD by 0.1 to get total OD of the original culture.
2.	Spin down 1mL of O/N culture into a 1.7mL tube (3min, 8,000 x g)
3.	Wash 2X with 1mL 1X TBS (1min, 8,000 x g)
4.	Resuspend washed cells in 1% SDS solution ((OD/6) * 1,000 = uL SDS to resuspend in)
* Remember to back-calculate from your dilution first!
5.	Allow cells to incubate at room temperature 5 minutes.
6.	Spindown cells to remove cell debris (1min, 8,000 x g)
7.	Remove supernatant to new tube (Liquid may be viscous/sticky, this is normal)
8.	Dilute sample 1:1 with 2X Laemmli buffer w/ß-ME (You don’t need to use all of sample, 100uL is likely sufficient)
* Note: This is a stopping point if you are mass-prepping samples. Make sure tubes are well mixed, and then store @ -20˚ C. When ready to run gels, thaw and then proceed with Step 9.
9.	Heat tube at 95˚ C for 15 minutes.

Notes:
* If your strain of interest does not pellet well, you may need to increase the speed or time of centrifugation.

# Protein Immunoblotting:

Chemical/Equipment Prep: 

1. Prepare 1X Tris/Glycine/SDS “Running” buffer, set aside.
* Running 1-2 gels: Make 750mL 1X Running buffer: 75mL of 10x stock in 675mL of DI H2O
* Running 3-4 gels: Make 1250mL 1X Running buffer: 125mL of 10x stock in 1125mL of DI H2O

1. Setup gel rig apparatus:
* Unpackage gel - remove green strip from base and remove comb (Select your gel depending on the size of your protein. Ex: VF_2432 is ~19 kDa, so use a 4-20% gel) (https://github.com/mjmlab/protocols/blob/master/sds-page.md#gel) 
* Set up gel in electrode assembly.
* If only one gel, use buffer dam
* Make sure wells face inside of the unit
* Use green clamps to secure gels
* Place electrode assembly into tank
* Pour running buffer into tank starting by filling the electrode assembly
* Electrode assembly should fill up and not leak into tank (Wait a minute or two to make sure there are no leaks.
* Wells should be filled with running buffer (Take a pipette tip and gently pipette running buffer into wells), also check if the loading walls are bent.
* Once assembly is full, fill tank to the 2 gel line with running buffer

Note: If you are only running one gel, you need to have it in the back of the tank, prongs can’t be in the front.

# Running the SDS-PAGE gel:

1.	Load the first lane with 5uL Thermo Scientific™ PageRuler™ Prestained 10-180kDa Protein Ladder.
2.	Transfer 20uL of each sample to respective gel lane (This can be optimized)
3.	Place lid on tank and hook up to HC power supply
4.	Run gel at 50V for 15 min, then increase power to 200V until dye front reaches the bottom of the gel (30 min)
5.	When run is complete, remove gel from apparatus. Use green lever and insert between plastic plates where black arrows indicate.
6.	Take gel to the gel doc, make a DI water puddle and rest gel on that, then image with the UV-Stain free option. **Record the exposure time noted in image settings**
7.	Rig buffer can be dumped down the drain.

# Running the Immunoblot:

Chemical Prep: 

While SDS-PAGE is running, prepare 1.25L of Transfer buffer:
* For 1.25L Transfer Buffer: 125 ml 10x Tris/Glycine buffer, 250 ml methanol, and 875 ml DI water 

NOTE: If running more than 2 transfers, you need another rig and 1.25L more Transfer buffer.

Immunoblot:

1.	After imaging gel, transfer into a clear plastic square dish with transfer buffer, allow to sit for 15 minutes (Do this immediately after imaging to keep the gel from drying out).
2.	In another plastic dish soak the two black sponge pieces and 2 pieces of filter paper in transfer buffer. (for about 15 minutes as well)
3.	Wet membrane in a little bit of 100% methanol (should appear wet and not separated from surrounding methanol for 1-2 minutes before assembling the sandwich. 
4.	Briefly swish the membrane in transfer buffer in one of the bins before use.
5.	Once everything has finished soaking, its sandwich time:
	* Get one of the transfer apparatuses (white and black swiss cheese looking thing), and place black side on the bench on a bunch of paper towels.
	* Place on one black sponge
	* Place on one piece of filter paper (it helps to add transfer buffer from one of the soak bins onto the filter paper to reduce bubbles forming under the gel.)
	* Place on gel (remember that gel will be mirrored in the output blot) use roller to remove any bubbles. Dump on a little transfer buffer from one of the bins.
	* Using forceps at the far right side and the smallest contact with a finger on the bottom left side, apply the membrane to the gel in one swift motion. DO NOT MOVE THE MEMBRANE AFTER IT IS DOWN.
	* Add another piece of filter paper on top of membrane and roll to remove bubbles (Roll in short movements across and up and down across the top filter paper.)
	* Add another sponge on top of that
	* At any of the above steps, it can help to wet the components by dumping on transfer buffer.
6.	Fold the clear section over the top of the sandwich and hold over the rig, then push clasp on and secure the transfer apparatus
7.	Put transfer apparatus into one of the red and black transfer setups in the rig (red side with red side, black with black)
8.	Black plate of sandwich faces black face of transfer setup, clear side faces the red side. Put the iceblock into the empty section. Fill rig with transfer buffer and close lid. Note: You will need the transfer buffer from your bins to fill up to the line. (Buffer can be kept in the 4C prior to use, probably want to fill the rig in the cold room cause it will be heavy)
9.	Plug rig into power supply in cold room, run at 100V for 30mins.
10.	When finished, disassemble the sandwich and clip one end of the membrane with scissors so you know the orientation of your samples.
* For testing transfer, clean the GelDoc Stain-free tray surface 2X with 70% EtOH
	* Select ‘Stain-free’ gel, then select the imaging menu, and set ‘Activation time’ to None, and use the manual exposure time to match the gel exposure time.
	* Make a DI H2O puddle, then lay the membrane down with protein side UP. Image using the exposure time used with the gel, then immediately proceed with Step 11. 
11.	Block membrane overnight in 50mL of 5% non-fat milk (50mL 1X TBS-T, 2.5g Non-fat milk), make sure to put in the membrane with the side touch the gel facing up. Use square containers with lid, store at 4˚C. 

# Day 3:

# Staining the Immunoblot:

Chemical Prep: (You will need to optimize your antibody dilutions based on your results.)

Primary Antibody solution: (Prepare in 10mL conical, flip to mix multiple times)
Reagent | Volume/mass
----|----
1X TBS-T | 10 mL
Non-fat milk | 0.05 g
Anti-target AB | X uL (Manufactuer forms have recommended dilutions)
Anti-RpoA Mouse IgG - 500 µg/mL | 2 uL  

* Make sure primary is NOT the same species IgG
  
1. Transfer membrane from O/N blotting solution to a pouch and add 10mL of primary antibody to the protein side. Rock at room temperature, 1 hour exactly. The protein side should be facing up in the pouch when you set it on the rocker.
2. Transfer the membrane to an empty tip box with 50mL 1X TBS-T, rock 15min, dump wash buffer in the sink. (Use forceps to prevent the membrane from falling out of the tip box)
3. Repeat Step 2. (In same bucket)
4. Repeat Step 2. (In same bucket)
5. Repeat Step 2. (In same bucket)

During wash steps, prepare the secondary antibody solution:

** Fluorescent Westerns: ** 

Secondary Antibody solution: (You will need to optimize your antibody dilutions based on your results.)
Reagent | Volume/mass
----|----
1X TBS-T | 10 ml
Non-fat milk | 0.05g 
LI-COR IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Species IgG 1000 µg/mL | 2uL
LI-COR IRDye® 680RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG 1000 µg/mL | 2uL

Secondary Antibody is light sensitive, so keep it in a foil wrapper after prep. (I prepared this solution ~3 min before use) Also, when doing fluorescent blots remember that your secondary antibodies must have different channels (600, 700, or 800 nm)

7. Transfer membrane to pouch, and add 10mL secondary antibody solution over the protein side. Rock for exactly 1 hour at room temperature in a FOIL WRAP.
8. Remove from pouch and transfer to 50mL 1X TBS-T buffer in a new tip box with a foil covered top protein side up. Rock 15min, then dump wash buffer.
9. Repeat Step 7. (In same bucket)
10. Repeat Step 7. (In same bucket)
11. Repeat Step 7 using 1X TBS instead of 1X TBS-T. (In different bucket)
12. Transfer membrane protein side up to a pre-prepped transfer setup (foil for covering gel from light, and a Saranwrap layer on top of the foil for allowing the membrane to sit on. Pull saranwrap over top of the membrane ensuring that wrinkles and bubbles are kept to a minimum. Fold foil over the whole thing to protect the membrane from light while transferring to LiCor. Note: I did this step with the lab lights off and it turned out really good, maybe do this in a dark room/dark space?

# Chemiluminescent Westerns:

Secondary Antibody solution: 
Reagent | Volume/mass
----|----
1x TBS-T | 10mL 
Non-fat milk | 0.05g 
Pierce Goat Anti-Rabbit HRP – 400 µg/mL | 2uL 

Secondary Antibody is light sensitive, so keep it in a foil wrapper after prep. (I prepared this solution ~3 min before use)
6. Transfer membrane to pouch, and add 10mL secondary antibody solution over the protein side. Rock for exactly 1 hour at room temperature in a FOIL WRAP.
7. Remove from pouch and transfer to 50mL 1X TBS-T buffer in a new tip box with a foil covered top protein side up. Rock 15min, then dump wash buffer.
8. Repeat Step 7. (In same bucket)
9. Repeat Step 7. (In same bucket)
10. Repeat Step 7. (In same bucket)
10A. Shortly (3 min before use), mix 3mL of both Thermo Fisher SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate solutions in a foiled conical tube.
11. Transfer membrane to a new clean bucket. Apply all 6mL of the SuperSignal mix to protein side of membrane by gently dropping all over the membrane, allow to sit for 5 minutes. (Do this in a darker room or under foil)
12. Transfer membrane protein side up to a pre-prepped transfer setup (foil for covering gel from light, and a Saranwrap layer on top of the foil for allowing the membrane to sit on. Pull saranwrap over top of the membrane ensuring that wrinkles and bubbles are kept to a minimum. Fold foil over the whole thing to protect the membrane from light while transferring to LiCor. Note: I did this step with the lab lights off and it turned out really good, maybe do this in a dark room/dark space?

# Imaging the Immunoblot:

1.  Take membrane in wrappings down to 3rd floor core room. LiCor is immediately to the right in the dark room. Login information should be on a post-it by the monitor.
2. Open the orange image study app (in the bottom taskbar)
3. Select your profile (if you do not have one, make one and make sure you set it to always use the Odyssey FC)
4. Load membrane into the LiCor (take the Saranwrapped membrane out of the foil and center it on  the loading tray. (DO NOT REMOVE FROM SARANWRAP).
5. For dual color fluorescence westerns, turn on the 700 and 800 channels. (You don’t need Chemi or 600). For chemiluminescent westerns, use chemi for the sample and 700 to visualize the ladder.
6. Do a first quick imaging using 30s exposure for 700 & 800 channels
7. Do a higher detail imaging using longer 2-5 min exposure for both channels. 
8. Tweak brightness then save a .png and export the image studio file .zip.
* DO NOT FORGET TO EXPORT THE IMAGE STUDIO FILE.
9. Save on a USB

## Appendix 1: Total Protein Staining with LI-COR Revert 700 Dye
* This method is an alternative to using Stain-free gels and allows you to measure total protein levels on the same LI-COR machine as you use for final visualization. You can use this dye with IR-Dye 680RD (700nm) and 800CW (800nm) secondary antibodies, but you will need to destain the membrane before putting it into the overnight blocking step. This stain uses very little stain and wash solution volumes from a kit, so baggies are needed to keep the membrane in contact with solutions.
1. After completing the transfer process, immediately transfer the clipped membrane (protein side up) onto a dry piece of filter paper. Incubate at RT for 1 hour to dry the membrane.
2. After allowing the membrane to dry, wet the membrane with 100% methanol as you did originally, for 30 s. 
3. Transfer rehydrated membrane to a wash bin, and wash with 50mL 1X TBS, 5 min with rocking.
4. Briefly swish the membrane in Ultra pure water (Cayman Chemical NC9543422) in a bin, then transfer to a baggie (similarily to antibody staining, however you will want larger corners on your baggies).
5. Add 5mL stain to protein side of membrane, and seal baggies, rock in foil for 5 minutes.
6. Snip a corner (larger baggies are better than smaller baggies, and decant out the stain solution into a waste bin.
* (larger baggies are better than smaller baggies
* All waste gets diluted down the drain with lots of tap water
7. Using a serological pipette, transfer in 5mL of wash solution into the hole you snipped in Step 6, over the protein side of the membrane. Reseal and rock for 30s in foil.
8. Snip open another corner, and decant out the wash solution, repeat step 7.
9. Rinse the membrane briefly with ultra pure water, then load into saran-wrap/foil packets and image on the 3rd floor LI-COR using the 700 channel. 
* In the past, 30s was enough to visualize samples, but you may need to change this depending on signal.
10. If using an IR-Dye 680RD secondary, you will need to follow the destaining protocol in the kit, once again using a baggie for the destaining solution.
11. Immediately return membranes to the lab, and place them in the overnight blocking buffer as in Step 11 of the Immunoblot.
